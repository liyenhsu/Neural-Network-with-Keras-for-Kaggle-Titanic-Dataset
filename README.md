# Neural Network with Keras for Kaggle's Titanic Dataset

The sinking of Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew were killed in this tragedy. The main reason leading to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for all the people. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

### Objective
Predict which passengers survived from the sinking Titanic.

### Required libraries
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- matlibplot
- Keras

### Data
train.csv: 891 passengers with 12 attributes, including the labels (survived or dead)

test.csv: 418 passengers with 11 attributes
